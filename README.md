# Week 9 Deep Learning Project
   
### Background problem / Goal:
In this project, the goal was to build an Artificial Neural Network recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

### Tools/Libraries Used: 
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras

### Workflow:
1. Data Acquisition
2. Building and compiling of the first model
3. Training and evaluating the model
4. Building and compiling of an improved model
5. Training and evaluating the improved model
6. Save Models to disk for prediction
7. Make Prediction
